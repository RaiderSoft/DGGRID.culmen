DGGRID Examples
===============

The subdirectories in this examples directory each
contain an example DGGRID metafile and associated
input files. See the comments in each metafile for 
details. The subdirectory sampleOutput contains output 
created by DGGRID for each of the examples.

Assuming dggrid is in your command search path, each 
example can be run using:

  dggrid theFileName.meta

Three bash shell scripts are provided. They are:

doexamples.sh - executes all examples and performs a
    diff of the output files with output that has been
    verified. Assumes that dggrid is in it's original
    build location (src/apps/dggrid). Note that 
    rounding errors may result in small differences
    in the output generated, depending on your system.

cleanexamples.sh - removes output files from all
    examples, returning the examples to their original
    state

copyexamples.sh - copy the outputs generated by the 
    last run of doexamples.sh into sampleOutput
